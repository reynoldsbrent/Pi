# Approximating π Using Random Points

This Python script demonstrates how to approximate the value of π (Pi) using random points generated within a square and compares the result with the actual value of π from the math library.

## About the Code

The script generates a specified number of random points within a square and determines if each point is inside or outside a circle inscribed within the square. By calculating the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points and multiplying it by 4, an approximation of the value of π is obtained.

## Example Output

Calculated value of π: 3.1416
Value of π from math library: 3.141592653589793
Difference: -0.00000765358979274
